# Cellular Automata

aka. [Cellular Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), <-- read more there

I recently watched [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk) which inspired me to build [something similar](https://andersryanc.github.io/cellular-automata/) <-- see it live there

Currently, I'm only doing a [one-dimentional](http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/) calculation, but I may expand this repo to have additional outputs / options.
